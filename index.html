        <p id="instructionsText">To play, please use your mouse to click and select each decision you want your pet to make. You can select different decisions such as Moves, Treats, 
          Toys, and Leave. Within Moves, Treats, and Toys there are specific choices you can select. Please click on the dialogue boxes to progress through the game.<br><br>
          The objective of the game is for your pet to maximize the happiness points of the other pet.
          Happiness points start at 0 at the beginning of each round and max out at 300. Reaching or exceeding 300 happiness points of the other pet will win you one round.<br><br> There are three rounds
          you must win in order for you to be victorious. A single loss in any of these rounds means you have lost the entire game (If your pet's happiness points reach or exceed 300). If you wish, 
          you may leave the game at any time by selecting the Leave decision.<br><br> Hovering over any of the specific choices you can click on will display a brief description of what the choice does. 
          Good luck and have fun!<br><br><br><br><p>

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p id="inspirationText">Hello, Let's Be Friends is a turn-based game where the objective is for your pet to make another pet happy. 
          The idea for this game came to me when I was thinking of things that would brighten my day. I thought the idea of pets gaining fulfillment out 
          of making each other happy was a fun idea so I created this game. I hope you enjoy playing this game as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>
