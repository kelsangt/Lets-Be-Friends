# Let's Be Friends

Let's Be Friends is a turn-based game where the objective is to make your opponent's pet happy. The user competes and employs strategies to win against their opponent, choosing what moves, treats, and toys will be used in order to secure victory.

As the main objective of the game is to be happy, players start out with their pets' HP (Happiness points) being set to 0. Throughout the interaction, moves made by the player and the opponent will affect their respective pets' HPs. To win, the user will have to win 3 rounds against their opponent. If the user loses one round, the game is over.

In Let's Be Friends, users will be able to:

- Use their keyboard to select what decision they want to make
- React to the moves and decisions made by the opponent, which will be controlled by the computer
- Hover over options to see what each move, treat, and toy does, in detail
- Employ strategies in order to win through the use of moves, treats, and toys


In addition, this project will include:
- An instructions window that will explain the game and the rules of the game
- A README

# Timeline

- Thursday Afternoon: Setup the project, sort out webpack, and research the Canvas API. Get the files up and running and figure out how the files interact with each other.
- Friday: Work on the game logic to figure out what each decision does and how it is coded.
- The Weekend: Finish up on the logic for the game and research animation to make the visuals of the game pop.
- Monday: Get the game to work on the screen and for the user to be able to play the game to its entirety. 
- Tuesday: Devote time to working on the styling of the game, making sure the presentation is great and fits my vision for the game.
- Wednesday: Improve styling of the game, see if I can expand the game if the timeline is going according to plan.
- Thursday: Deploy project to GitHub. Look over all the files and make revisions as needed.


# Bonus Features

This game can be expanded by adding a 2D walking aspect, where the user model can walk around a town, interacting with other people to begin interactions. This will then transition to the competitive interaction mode, where the user makes decisions.
